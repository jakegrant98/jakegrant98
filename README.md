- Hi, I’m @jakegrant98! I am an Atlanta-based young professional who dabbles in some code on the side after spending five years getting bachelor's and master's of mechanical engineering from Georgia Tech. Most of my experience is in MatLab, but over the past two years, I have spent time doing some development in Python on various projects and have also dabbled in Java in the past.
- My primary interests are in sports analytics, though I am certainly the second-best in the field on my two man podcast about Tech sports, as well as a strong interest in transportation, particularly aviation and public transit, as well the intersection of history with the built environment, though I haven't turned any ideas into code on that last one yet.
- I’m currently learning how to better acquire and manipulate data. In the past this has been a very manual process, and I would like to pivot to automating more of the tools I have been working on in the past. API is a part of this, while at the same time I am looking at developing a web app to better house and run my projects.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting, really. I am a quick learner, but having limited formal Python training means that I am always open to picking up new skills I may have missed in the process.
- You can find me via email at jake.t.grant63@gmail.com or on Twitter at @jakegrant98. In addition, you can see some of my personal and collaborative work in sports analytics in action at fromtherumbleseat.com online and @FTRSBlog on Twitter, in the form of the ratings composite for Tech sports I developed, as well as some other projects I have assisted on.
